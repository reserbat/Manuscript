	     \caption{\textbf{Coupling of emission to graphene membrane displacement.}  \textbf{a}: Confocal reflection maps of a graphene membrane deflected electrostatically. Each map is recorded at a fixed $\delta_{G-NV}$ given by a static backgate voltage $V_g^{dc}$. The graphene membrane acts as a mobile absorber in the standing wave formed by a single-sided cavity, absorbing a fraction $n_{layer}\pi\alpha I\left ( x,y,\delta_{G-NV}\right )$ at a given point. By electrostatic displacement, the membrane is also warped, leading to a different reflection profile and intensity for a given $V_g^{dc}$. $\delta_{G-NV} \propto \left (\Delta V_g^{dc}\right )^2$. \textbf{b}: NVC emission strength controlled by electrostatic deflection of the membrane. With increasing $\left (\Delta V_g^{dc}\right )^2$, the membrane approaches the NVC, thereby reducing the graphene emitter separation $\delta_{G-NV}$ and quenching the NVC emission. Fitting with eq. 1 allows for calibration of the electrostatic deflection. \textbf{c}: NVC emission versus excitation laser power $P_{laser}$ at two extreme cases of membrane deflection. At rest (\textcolor{red}{$\bullet$}), the power dependence is stronger than at the point of highest deflection (\textcolor{vert}{$\bullet$}) due to enhanced quenching at smaller separations. \textbf{d}: Theoretical dependence of emission (bottom) and differential emission (top) of a single emitter on the distance to a graphene membrane $\delta_{G-NV}$.	Inset : energy diagrams of an optical emitter and graphene at the \textbf{K} point of the Brillouin zone (Dirac cone). For small separations $\delta_{G-NV}< 50$nm, the relaxation of the excited emitter is predominantly non-radiative due to the excitation of electron-hole pairs in graphene.}\label{fig:fig2}

	     \caption{\textbf{Readout of graphene nano-motion via NVC emission.} \textbf{a}: Time trace of NVC emission (grey bars) modulated by a driven graphene membrane oscillating in its near field. Distance-dependent  quenching imprints the nano-motion of the graphene membrane onto the emission. \textbf{b}: Mechanical resonance obtained from differential NVC emission. Each point corresponds to the amplitude of the Fourier component at $f=f_{drive}$ of the emission time trace (as in \textbf{a}). A Lorentzian fit of the data (red line) yields the same value for $f_m$ as obtained independently by optical interferometry. \textbf{c}: Differential emission (blue) as a function of $\left ( \Delta V_g^{dc}\right )^2$, normalised by the oscillation amplitude $A_m$ of the membrane at resonance.}\label{fig:fig3}
