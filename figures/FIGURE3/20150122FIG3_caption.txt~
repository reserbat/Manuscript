FIG3  : Readout of graphene nano-motion via NVC emission. a) Time trace of NVC emission (gray bars) modulated by a driven graphene membrane
with mechanical resonance frequency 立 m oscillating in its near field. Distance-dependent emission quenching imprints the nano-motion of the graphene membrane onto the emission. b) Mechanical spectrum of a graphene membrane, extracted by Fourier transform of emission time traces. The amplitude of the component at the resonance frequency
立 m , measured independently by optical interferometry, is plotted against the drive frequency 立 drive , showing a peak at 立 m . 
c) Amplitude of emission fluctuations as a function of \Delta V_g_DC^2, normalised to the oscillation amplitude \A_m of the membrane at resonance: \beta \proportional A_FFT(Omega_m/2pi)/A_m . Here, \delta_[G-NV] decreases with increasing \delta V_g_DC^2 due to attractive electrostatic membrane displacement.
