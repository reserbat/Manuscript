FIG1  : Graphene hybrid optomechanical device. a) False colour electronic micrograph of a graphene membrane suspended over nano-diamonds with NVCs deposited in holes. b) Confocal reflection (left) and emission (right) spatial maps of a hybrid resonator. The bright fluorescent spot corresponds to the NVC emission contained in the localized nano-diamonds. c: sketch of the hybrid optomechanical device. The graphene resonator can be driven and displaced  electrostatically while its nano-motion can be analysed optically. d: Noise spectra of a graphene resonator at 300K detected by optical interferometry.
