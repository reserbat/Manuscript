FIG1  : Graphene hybrid optomechanical device. a) False colour electronic micrograph of a graphene membrane suspended over nano-diamonds with NVCs deposited in holes. b) Confocal reflection (left) and emission (right) spatial maps of a hybrid resonator. The bright fluorescent spot corresponds to localized emission from NVCs embedded in the nano-diamonds. c) Sketch of the hybrid optomechanical device. The graphene resonator is driven and displaced  electrostatically, while its nano-motion is analysed optically. d) Noise spectrum of a graphene resonator at 300K detected by optical interferometry.
